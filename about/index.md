As a work of collaborative fiction, *Post-Self* maintains cohesion through a shared universe and a core set of characters. From there, authors are encouraged to expand on what it means to live in a universe where the concept of self is blurred, or even erased. Here, you can find information on how to contribute, as well as information on the universe in which the stories take place and any characters that are free to use. Finally, there's a list of folks who have contributed to the project.
