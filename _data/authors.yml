# Instructions:
# Create a top-level entry with a username for linking (starts with a letter,
# contains letters, numbers, and underscores). Within that entry, you will need
# a uri which must be http://post-self.io/about/contributors#<id> where <id>
# is the key for the top-level entry (this is for jekyll-feed, which needs to
# know how to link to your profile), a name for displaying, a bio (markdown is
# permitted), and an optional metadata list, which contains a list of objects.
#
# Supported metadata types are:
#   * twitter
#   * github
#   * website
#
# Keep this file ordered alphabetically by username. A suggestion, given the style in which branches are notated in the PS universe, would be to structure the name entry as "Proper Name#username" and mention instances in your bio.

  bio: |
    Riismo is an engineer and ne'er-do-well from New England. He enjoys breaking things and (time permitting) fixing them, which is an approach that works more often than it ought to and at least is interesting when it doesn't. He's also a furry, and on most days a rather grumpy one.
